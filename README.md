# Feed-Reader Testing P6 Front-end Nanodegree

## Project Overview

Feed-Reader Testing is a Udacity Frontend Nanodgree project teaching the
bascis of code testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), a javascript
testing library. The goal of the completed project is to write a complete spec
detailing suites adequately testing the various features in the provided feed-
reader application and potentially testing features yet to be implemented in
the current application version.

## Install

For the latest version, clone this [repository](https://github.com/tswei/feedreader) from GitHub.

## Instructions to Run.

Open in your browser `file:///C:/PATH_TO_ROOT/index.html`

Both the Jasmine testing suite and the feed-reader application should run from
this file location.

## Documentation

Documentation for Jasmine can be found on their [homepage](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html).

## Additional Features to be Implemented

In addition to the exisiting features, tests have been created for expected future features of this RSS feed application. These tests expect the ability to add and delete an RSS feed from this web-application. When adding, the application will throw an error unless the new feed has both a valid name and url. When deleting, the application should remove the feed link from both the model and the DOM.
